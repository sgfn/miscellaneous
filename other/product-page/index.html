                <h2>Top quality engineering</h2>
                <p>Our teams of world-renowned scientists, mechanics and programmers have worked tirelessly throughout
                    the
                    years to make a first-in-its-kind fully autonomous, self-driving car capable of safely traversing
                    narrow
                    city streets packed with traffic and pedestrians, long stretches of highways requiring constant
                    attention, as well as all other types of roads. They have achieved it, and are continuing to develop
                    our
                    <strong>nudle Car&trade;</strong>, constantly making it better than ever before.</p>

                <h2>Advanced AI algorithms</h2>
                <p>We believe your safety is of utmost importance. That's why our <strong>nudle Car&trade;</strong> is
                    running the latest software equipped with sophisticated Artificial Intelligence technology, tested
                    in
                    our labs and in the field, capable of navigating itself and its passengers from A to B in one piece.
                    It
                    gathers information on its surroundings from 30 different sensors and analyzes them, utilizing our
                    top-tier road maps: <strong>nudle Maps&trade; Pro</strong> with 16 times the detail of nudle
                    Maps&trade;

                <h2>Environment-friendly</h2>
                <p>It is high time to say goodbye to traditional combustion engines. <strong>nudle Car&trade;</strong>
                    comes
                    in two variants: one with a fully electric, 700 KW engine, capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph
                    in
                    as low as 1,37 seconds; and one with an unprecedented idea in the automobile industry - an extremely
                    efficient, cheap in exploitation Jinseng-Loewenstein Hydrogen Fusion Engine. Both versions of the
                    car
                    are zero-emission, making <strong>nudle&trade;</strong> the face of the transformation of the entire
                    industry - a change beneficial to all human beings as well as our planet.</p>
